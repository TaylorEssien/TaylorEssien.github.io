I am a third year PhD Candidate in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University advised by Dr. Russ Joseph. I earned my bachelors of science in Computer Engineering at Howard University in 2022. My research interests are in computer architecture and logic design. My current project focuses on leveraging Python to generate and reconfigure processors supporting pipelined memory access. This past summer I interned with Tenstorrent, investigating the use of machine learning for hardware design and verification. In 2023, I interned with Cadence Design Systems Inc., learning physical design. I serve as the 2024-2025 President of the Black Graduate Student Association at Northwestern University.
